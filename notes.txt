notes

Elixir Syntax
  CoffeeScript is to JavaScript
  as
  Elixir is to Erlang

Right?

Wrong.

# Changing Paradigms

+ OOP to FP
+ Managed Concurrency to Automatic Concurrency



# Syntax
You like curly brackets? We got 'em.
You like square brackets? We got those too.
You like semicolons? Fuck you.


# Concurrency
  + Mutexes
  + Semaphores
  + AtomicTypes
  + and the list goes on...


THESE ARE PROBLEMS FOR MUTABLE LANGUAGES.

# Processes
+ Not your grandma's process (unless your grandma does Erlang)

1. "spun up" in sub microseconds
1. NO shared data
1. Message passing
1. Monitor each other for failure.


Erlang is an OS.



# design

top level (come up with the way you want to do things. then implement the how.)
