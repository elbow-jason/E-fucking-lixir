notes

Elixir Syntax
  CoffeeScript is to JavaScript
  as
  Elixir is to Erlang

Right?

Wrong.
	1. errors are better.
	2. custom types.
	3. custom behaviors.
	4. META-PROGRAMMING.
	5. More useful abstractions of OTP concepts

Why


# Changing Paradigms
+ OOP to FP
+ Managed Concurrency to Automatic Concurrency



# Syntax
Rubyesque Syntax (in every way)
You like curly brackets? We got 'em.
You like square brackets? We got those too.
You like semicolons? Fuck you.
No `return` word.
Every call returns something implicitly (last expression)
Functions have arity. (arity refers to the number of arguments)
Pattern Matching everywhere.


# Ruby
('a'..'z').each {    |c|    puts     c   }

#Elixir
?a..?z |> Enum.each fn c -> IO.puts [c] end

elixir is ruby is elixir



# Concurrency in Mutable languages.
  + Mutexes
  + Semaphores
  + AtomicTypes
  + and the list goes on...


THESE ARE PROBLEMS FOR MUTABLE LANGUAGES.

# Processes
+ Not your grandma's process (unless your grandma does Erlang)

1. "spun up" in sub microseconds
1. NO shared data
1. Message passing
1. Monitor each other for failure.


Erlang is an OS.



# design

top level (come up with the way you want to do things. then implement the how.)


# Why functional?


* What state is some object in at any given moment? (This is hard to reason about)
* concurrency
* programming should be about transforming data (not hiding state(sorry OOP))


# Rebuttals?

Q: doesn't immutable state lead to copying TONS of data?
A: WAIT FOR THE PRESENTATION.


# Pattern Matching (is everything)

* bind variables
* "branch" logically
* declarative code


# "Assignment"

* There is no assignment.
* There is only pattern matching followed by binding.

How does it work?

binding is like assertion.
the code `x = 1` is an attempt to get the pattern on the right to match the pattern on the left
when the patterns can be matched the right-pattern is bound to the variable on the left

##### simple

```
iex(1)> x = 1  # x can match 1 thus x is bound to 1
1
iex(2)> x  # x is in fact bound to 1
1
iex(3)> 1 = x  # just like a passing assertion, no error
1
iex(4)> 2 = x  # error
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: 1
```


##### complex

notice the underscore. it is a discarded variable. _ will match anything and will always be unbound!

```
iex(1)>{:+, _, args} = quote do 1 + 1 end
{:+, [context: Elixir, import: Kernel], [1, 1]}
iex(2)>args
[1, 1]

```

##### another

```
iex(1)> [x, x] = [1, 1]
[1, 1]
iex(2)> x
1
iex(3)> [y, y] = [1, 2]
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: [1, 2]
```

##### variable protection

we want x to remain 1

```
iex(1)> x = 1
1
iex(2)> [x, 3] = [2, 3]
[2, 3]
iex(3)> x
2
```

the previous is not what we wanted to happen. x was not protected. x needs a hardhat.

```
iex(1)> x = 1
1
iex(2)> [^x, 3] = [2, 3]
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: [2, 3]
```

##### THIS IS ALGEBRA.

Look at this code:
```
^x = 4 - x
```

Under what conditions would the previous code not cause an error (hint: solve for x)

x + x = 4 - x + x
x + x = 4
2x = 4
2x / 2 = 4 / 2
x = 2

Let's test this out.


```
iex(1)> x = 2
2
iex(2)> ^x = 4 - x
2
iex(3)> x = 3
3
iex(4)> ^x = 4 - x
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: 1
```


# IMMUTABLE DATA EVERYWHERE

Mutable data is the devil you've been looking for...

some programming lang
```
value = 100
do_something_with(value)
print value
```
The above prints `100`? Right?

```
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
do_something_with(my_list)
print my_list
```
The above prints `[1, 2, 3]`? Right?





There is no way to know what the value of `my_list` is.

What happens if this same list is exposed to execution in multiple threads?

In Elixir, this is a non-issue. A list [1,2,3] is created in memory. Nothing ever changes the list [1,2,3].

##### POTENTIAL ISSUES WITH PERFORMANCE

###### Copying structures
For many, the efficiency of building entire data structures every time a new variable is bound is a concern.
Fear not. That is not what is happening. In Elixir(read Erlang), data is immutable. When a child structure uses
any of the components of the parent, the child becomes a branch on the parent structure (think version control).
This branch + parent is the child. This method of structure building allows extremely fast, efficient handling
of "copying" structured data. Boom.

example:
iex(1)> x = [2,1]
[2, 1]
iex(2)> y = [3 | x]
[3, 2, 1]


y is a list that consists of a head (3) and a tail (x which is [2, 1])


/me is about to wreck someone's day


How many elements in y ?

3

How many lists in y ?

4 (for real)


```
iex(6)> length(y)
3
iex(7)> [3| [2| [1| []]]] == y
true
```

lists are a recursive structure.


##### Processes and GC - Processes

A Process:

* is not a operating system process.
* is isolated.
* uses a small amount of memory.("A newly spawned Erlang process uses 309 words of memory in the non-SMP emulator without HiPE support.") (link)[http://www.erlang.org/doc/efficiency_guide/processes.html]
* has its own unique Process ID (pid; included in the 309 words of memory)
* has its own inbox (refered to by pid)
* has its own heap and stack
* has its own garbage collection

##### Elixir Processes and GC - GC

Code is written to take advantage of these Processes and as such many, many
Processes are 'networked' together to form an application.

There are benefits to this model:
* heaps remain small - GC is faster.
* Each Process's GC is an idependent action (because each has it's own heap).
* There is no world freezing GC.
* When a process terminates it is not GCed. It is discarded. (usually (see heap reallocation))


Types (Hooray!!!)
Value types:
	* Integers
		* arbitrary size
		* underscorable
		* 1000000000000000000000000000000000000_00000_00000_00000_00000_00000
		* 4_0_9_5 #legit
		* 0xFFF # hex for 4095
		* 0b111111111111 # binary for 4095
		* 0o7777 # octal for 4095
	* Floats
		* 1.2
		* 10.0e9
		* 10.0e-9
		* max value ~10.0e308
		* 16 places of precision
	* Atoms
		* :boom
		* :"Some atom with spaces"
		* a literal that starts with colon always
		* an atom refers into an atom table
		* not GCed
		* max count allowed 1048576 (then death)
	* Regex
		* ~r/foo/

	* Bools
		* no
	* Strings
		* no
	* Null
		* no
	* Joking?
		* no

Composite Types:
	* Ranges
		* a range between integers
		* inclusive
		* 1..10 (iterable)
		* 1..10.1 (uniterable)
		* see ranger.exs
	* Tuples
		* {:ok, result} = File.read("README.md")
		* delimited by `{` and `}`
		* ordered
		* conventionally used for returning from IO funcs
	* Lists
		* recursive
		* singly-linked
		* two forms:
			* `[head | tail]` where `tail` is a list and head is a whatever.
			* `[]` empty
		* `++` for concat
		* `--` for remove
		* `--` and `++` are sometimes inefficient.

		```
		* iex(17)> [1] ++ [2,3] -- [3]
		* [1, 2]
		```

	* Keyword Lists
		* Ordered Key Value Store
		* [{:name, "Jason"}]
		* lists with bi-tuples in them where the first element of the bi-tuple is an atom
		* [name: "Jason"] == [{:name, "Jason"}] #sugar
		* nothing special beyond the sugar.
		* used mostly for keyword args / options of functions
	* Maps
		* Unordered Key-Value Store
		* `%{1 => "one", 2 => "two", 3 => 3}`
		* `css = %{ border: "1px solid blue", height: 30, width: 40 }`
		* `mixed = %{ {:ok, 1} => 1, 1 => "one", red: true}`
		* bracket access
			* `mixed[1]
			* `mixed[:red]
			* `mixed[{:ok, 1}]`
			* `nil` for non-member `css[:wtf_is_this]`
		* dot access
			* `mixed.red`
			* `css.border`
			* for stringy keys only
			* `KeyError` for non-member (`css.wtf_is_this`)
		* Arbitrary keys (?)
		* changing values
			```
			iex(8)> some_map = %{ a: "ay", b: "bee", c: "dee"}
			%{a: "ay", b: "bee", c: "dee"}
			iex(9)> some_map = %{ some_map | c: "sea" }
			%{a: "ay", b: "bee", c: "sea"}
			```

	* Binaries
		* A thing that looks a lot like Strings
			* "Jason"
			* age = 31; "Jason is #{age}"  # this is valid, but you're an asshole if you type this anywhere but the console.
			* Ridiculously good support for Unicode. (maybe because José Valim has/had the need)
			* `<>` for concat
		* Actual Binary Manipulation
			* `<>` for concat
			```
			iex(1)> num = << 2 :: size(2), 1 :: size(4), 3 :: size(2)>>
			<<135>>
			# the above is a 3 part byte of the shape 2,4,2 -> 22 4444 22
			iex(2)> 0b10
			2
			iex(3)> 0b0001
			1
			iex(4)> 0b11
			3
			iex(5)> 0b10000111
			135
			iex(6)> byte_size num
			1
			```

	* HashDict
		* Efficient Key-Value Store
		* Efficient AF (as f*) with large number of keys
		* no literal syntax (afaik)
		* x = HashDict.new # for new ones
		* y = HashDict.put(x, "hungry?", true)

	* HashSet
		* A set.
		* You get it.

	* Char List
		* a list of ints that map to codepoints.
		* the devil.
		* single quoted "strings" (they are not strings) that look like 'this right here' are actually lists of ints.
		* a crappy type of string that Erlang deals with.
		* any list of ints that can be represented as a charlist is represented as a charlist.
		* is a list of ints any different than a char list? No.
		* DONT USE THIS TYPE. YOU'LL WANT TO DIE. I WISH IT WAS GONE.
		```
		iex(28)> [108, 111, 108]
		'lol'
		```

	* Structs
		* A predefined, compile-time guarenteed to-be-shaped map.
		* Resembles OOP class.
		* Don't be tempted to use this as a class. (You could, but then you'd be doing OOP)


System Types:
	* Ports
		* for IO and interaction with binaries

	* Pids
		* identifies a process

	* References
		* for referencing References
		* usually timers and unique things
		* A reference is a term which is unique in an Erlang runtime system, created by calling make_ref/0.


Special Types:
	* Truthiness
		* truthiness is represented by an atom :true
		* or by an identifier true
		* true == :true

	* Falseyness
		* falseyness is represented by an atom :false
		* or by an identifier false
		* false == :false

	* Nullyness
		* nullyness is represented by an atom :nil
		* or by an identifier nil
		* nil == :nil

Other Language Features:

	* PIPELINEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
		* compose functions in a way that makes sense instead of backward or using intermediate useless variables.
		* WATCH THIS F**K**G MAGIC

		With intermediates variables:

		```
		customer     = Query.get_customer(id)
		stores       = Store.near(customer, [miles: 5])
		sales        = Sales.get_from_list(stores)
		sorted_sales = Enum.sort(sales, fn s1, s2 -> s1.percentage > s2.percentage end)

		```

		With nested function calls:

		```
		#This is totally lame.
		sorted_sales = Enum.sort(Sales.get_from_list(Store.near(Query.get_customer(id), [miles: 5])), fn s1, s2 -> s1.percentage > s2.percentage end)
		```

		With pipes:
		```
		sorted_sales = id
		|> Query.get_customer
		|> Store.near([miles: 5])
		|> Sales.get_from_list
		|> Enum.sort(fn s1, s2 -> s1.percentage > s2.percentage end)

		# This makes reasoning about what exactly is going on very easy.
		```

	* Macros
		* In a bit.

	* Running code from other modules
		* all "imports/requires/aliases" are only applicable to current block and its sub-blocks. (read 'lexically scoped')
		* private functions cannot be imported (duh.)
		* `require`
			* `require MyMod` makes functions in `MyMod` with `MyMod.some_func` syntax.
		* `import`
			* `import MyMod` makes functions in `MyMod` available with `some_func` syntax (naked functions)
			* implicit imports are frowned upon.
			* ambiguous calls to functions (`Kernel.length` always available as `length` vs imported `String`'s `length`) will not compile.
			```
			defmodule NoCompile do
			  import String

			  def wont_work(x) do
			    length x
			  end
			end
			```
			```
			iex(30)> c "no_compile.exs"

			== Compilation error on file no_compile.exs ==
			** (CompileError) no_compile.exs:5: function length/1 imported from both String and Kernel, call is ambiguous
			    (elixir) src/elixir_dispatch.erl:110: :elixir_dispatch.expand_import/6
			    (elixir) src/elixir_dispatch.erl:81: :elixir_dispatch.dispatch_import/5
			    (elixir) src/elixir_exp_clauses.erl:16: :elixir_exp_clauses.def/5
			    (elixir) src/elixir_def.erl:160: :elixir_def.translate_definition/8
			    (elixir) src/elixir_def.erl:82: :elixir_def.store_definition/9
			```
		* `import` options
			* allows excellent controls over imports
			* import String, except: [length:1]
			* import String, only: [to_float:1]
			* import String, only: :functions
			* import MyMod, only: :macros
		* `alias`
			* less typing?
			* `alias String, :as S`
			* `alias MyMod.SubMod` makes `SubMod.func` syntax available as opposed to `MyMod.SubMod.func`

		* `use`
			* this is the way to invoke macrofication/behavior from other modules.
			* wait for macros, please

		* Erlang
			* Erlang modules are called with atom syntax
			* :observer.start
			* :math.pow(5,3)


	* List Comprehensions
		* For when you don't know about recursion or the Enum module?
		* I dont get it.

		```
		iex(10)> for x <- [1,2,3,4], do: x * x
		[1, 4, 9, 16]
		```

		* quick swap
		```
		iex(11)> people = [
			{"jason", "datamelon"},
			{"ian",   "hiring solved"},
			{"austin", "ASU and NASA"},
		]
		[{"jason", "datamelon"}, {"ian", "hiring solved"}, {"austin", "ASU and NASA"}]
		iex(12)> for {person, org} <- people, do: {org, person}
		[{"datamelon", "jason"}, {"hiring solved", "ian"}, {"ASU and NASA", "austin"}]
		```
		* whoopty doo

Protocols:
	* 7 builtins
		* Access - bracket access for keyword lists, maps, hashdicts.
		* Enumerable
			* used by Enum and Stream
			* turns Collectables to Lists
			* allows for infinite collections, resources, and structures with fixed shape
		* Collectable - turns Enumerable into a collection
		* Inspect - print anything.
		* List.Chars - turns things to char_list type. The Devil, Bobby Boucher.
		* Range.Iterator - A protocol used for iterating range elements.
		* String.Chars - A protocol for converting a structure to a Binary (only if applicable)
			*allows for interpolation*"foo#{bar}"; equivalent to "foo" <> to_string(bar)





Modules:
	* `defmodule` macro
	* CapitalizedCamelCase
	* `defmodule MyModule do` ... `end` syntax
	* convention: one per file
	* convention: file is named underscore case of module name  `MyModule` goes in `my_module.ex` or `.exs`
	* If you break these conventions and your name is not José Valim then José Valim will come get you in your sleep.
	* attributes `@attrthing` only at top of module



Defined Functions:
	* `def` macro
	* only definable inside Modules
	* multiline syntax:   `def my_func do` ... `end`
	* single line syntax: `def square(x), do: x * x`  (notice the lack of the `end` keyword)
	* private functions:  `defp my_private_func` ... `end`
	* private functions:  only direct accessible within the Module of its definition
	* called with or without parens `MyModule.myfunc x` or `MyModule.myfunc(x)`
	* Passable with ampersand syntax. WAIT FOR IT.\
	* Can have guard clauses.
	* Can have default args.

Anonymous Functions:
	* `fn` keyword (macro? I'd bet it is.)
	* `sq = fn item -> item * item end`
	* called with dot syntax: `sq.(2)`
	* so that no calls become ambiguous dot syntax is necessary
	* multi-bodied
	```
	decider = fn
		1 -> "only one"
		2 -> "two"
		3 -> "three"
		x -> handle_edge_case(x)
	end

	function_maker = fn -> (fn -> "hi" end) end
	```
	* close over their shadowing scope (closures)
	```
	iex(3)> x = 1
	1
	iex(4)> fun = fn -> x end
	#Function<20.106461118/0 in :erl_eval.expr/5>
	iex(5)> fun.()
	1
	iex(6)> x = 3333
	3333
	iex(7)> fun.()
	1

	```
	* passable as arguments
	* alternate syntax (only use for very simple things)
	```
	&(&1 + &2) # is equivalent to
	fn item1, item2 -> item1 + item2 end
	```

	* ampersand is also used to 'anonymize named functions'
	```
	iex(2)> [1,2,3,4] |> Enum.map(&Integer.is_odd/1)
	[true, false, true, false]

	```

#

# Pattern Matching
	ANY PATTERN CAN BE MATCHED*. *except value-matching for maps. This would be a poor use case though. its a reverse mapping. can have multiple potential matches. has no guarentee of result. violates functional programming principles. the list goes on...
	* There is no soft failure.
	* Exhaustive matching is recommended.
	* Begin thinking in pattern matching. Realize the other languages you use have nothing like it. Get sad.
	* Allows code to be declarative instead of imperative. (NO IF STATEMENTS.)
	* stops on first match and excutes binding/block/function
	Used in:
		* destructuring
			```
			iex(14)> [a,b,c] = [1,2,3]
			[1, 2, 3]
			iex(15)> a
			1
			iex(16)> c
			3
			iex(17)> x = %{name: "Jason", age: 31, ht: 72, wt: 250} # I'm dieting. Please reserve judgement.
			%{age: 31, ht: 72, name: "Jason", wt: 250}
			iex(18)> %{name: name} = x
			%{age: 31, ht: 72, name: "Jason", wt: 250}
			iex(19)> name
			"Jason"

			```

		* case logic
